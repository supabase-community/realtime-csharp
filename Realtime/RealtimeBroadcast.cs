	/// Broadcast follows the publish-subscribe pattern where a client publishes messages to a channel with a unique identifier.
	/// Other clients can elect to receive the message in real-time by subscribing to the channel with the same unique identifier. If these clients are online and subscribed then they will receive the message.
	///
	/// Broadcast works by connecting your client to the nearest Realtime server, which will communicate with other servers to relay messages to other clients.
	/// A common use-case is sharing a user's cursor position with other clients in an online game.
