  flipped when encountering a channel error.

## 6.0.0 - 2023-05-22

- Merges [#28](https://github.com/supabase-community/realtime-csharp/pull/28)
  and [#30](https://github.com/supabase-community/realtime-csharp/pull/30)
- The realtime client now takes a "fail-fast" approach. On establishing an initial connection, client will throw
  a `RealtimeException` in `ConnectAsync()` if the socket server is unreachable. After an initial connection has been
  established, the **client will continue attempting reconnections indefinitely until disconnected.**
- [Major, New] C# `EventHandlers` have been changed to `delegates`. This should allow for cleaner event data access over
  the previous subclassed `EventArgs` setup. Events are scoped accordingly. For example, the `RealtimeSocket` error
  handlers will receive events regarding socket connectivity; whereas the `RealtimeChannel` error handlers will receive
  events according to `Channel` joining/leaving/etc. This is implemented with the following methods prefixed by (
  Add/Remove/Clear):
    - `RealtimeBroadcast.AddBroadcastEventHandler`
    - `RealtimePresence.AddPresenceEventHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddStateChangedHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddMessageReceivedHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddHeartbeatHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddErrorHandler`
    - `RealtimeClient.AddDebugHandler`
    - `RealtimeClient.AddStateChangedHandler`
    - `RealtimeChannel.AddPostgresChangeHandler`
    - `RealtimeChannel.AddMessageReceivedHandler`
    - `RealtimeChannel.AddErrorHandler`
    - `Push.AddMessageReceivedHandler`
- [Major, new] `ClientOptions.Logger` has been removed in favor of `Client.AddDebugHandler()` which allows for
  implementing custom logging solutions if desired.
    - A simple logger can be set up with the following:
  ```c#
  client.AddDebugHandler((sender, message, exception) => Debug.WriteLine(message));
  ```
- [Major] `Connect()` has been marked `Obsolete` in favor of `ConnectAsync()`
- Custom reconnection logic has been removed in favor of using the built-in logic from `Websocket.Client@4.6.1`.
- Exceptions that are handled within this library have been marked as `RealtimeException`s.
- The local, docker-composed test suite has been brought back (as opposed to remotely testing on live supabase servers)
  to test against.
- Comments have been added throughout the entire codebase and an `XML` file is now generated on build.
